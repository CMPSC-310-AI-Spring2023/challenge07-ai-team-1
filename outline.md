## Prompt

We are going to discuss how AI can make a positive impact in the classroom, and attempt to show educators how AI can be integrated into the classroom.

With that being said we first would want to discuss how AI in education can be a good thing for teachers. We also want to advocate for AI and how teachers would be able to curve out cheating and make AI a tool students would be able to learn from. We want to discuss in detail who would benefit from incorporating AI in schools and what age group it would be appropriate to start use at. We understand some of the concerns associated with AI in the classroom, especially from the educators perspective, so we will be addressing this issue.

Taking a deeper look into AI in education we can start listing the benefits and what specific age group it should implemented so it doesn't become a crutch. It also needs to be regulated too. We also want to start going into depth for each of these.

We also want to start figuring out how we could implement these changes into the school system. Some suggestions could be training for educators and making specific AI for educators to use in assisting the education curriculum. One of the benefits of AI is the personalization, which can be used to positively change students' experiences.

## Conclusion

Together we are going to explore unique points surrounding this issue. Each of us are going to discuss why our unique topics are important to the general topic. We are going to be displaying this information by form of multiple Instagram posts with captions.

As AI is becoming more prevalent in the classroom, educators are raising concerns about the impacts it will have on students' learning experiences. Some concerns that are frequently brought up are:

- AI takes away the opportunity to think critically through problems.
- AI sucks the creativity out of the classroom.
- Students will become too reliant on technology and AI.
- The accuracy and bias of AI are uncertain.

But is AI really all that bad? Today we are going to take a deeper dive into some of the benefits and challenges of integrating AI into the education system.

AI can be used in a classroom setting to help educators teach. AI is evolving more and more by the day, and educators can use AI in certain ways to make things easier for them. If educators learned how to use AI, they could figure out how to use it to help them and their students. Educators could lighten their work load and they could also use it in certain ways to help them teach their students

Intelligent tutoring can be used by educators to improve student engagement and academic performance. This would help educators give their students a more personalized learning experience based on what the AI tutor says. AI can analyze student data and adapt to their learning styles by providing them with feedback that is tailored to their individual needs and abilities.

AI can take on many of the time consuming jobs that educators are currently expected to do. For example record keeping, and marking up grades. It can also help educators do their planning for things and help them come up with ideas for projects and assignments. AI can be used to help educators come up with learning objectives for students as well.
