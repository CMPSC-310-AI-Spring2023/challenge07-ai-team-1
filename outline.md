We aslo want to advocate for AI and how teachers would be able to curve out cheating and make an AI a tool students would be able to learn from. We want to discuss in detail who would benefit from incorporating Ai in schools and what age group it would be appropriate to start use at.

Taking a deeper look into AI in education we can start listing the benefits and what specific age group it should implemented so it doesn't become a crutch. It also needs to be regulated too. We also want to start going into depth for each of these.
