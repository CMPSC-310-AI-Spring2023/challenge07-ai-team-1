## Prompt

We are going to discuss how AI can make a positive impact in the classroom, and attempt to show educators how AI can be integrated into the classroom. 

With that being said we first would want to discuss how AI in education can be a good thing for teachers. We aslo want to advocate for AI and how teachers would be able to curve out cheating and make an AI a tool students would be able to learn from. We want to discuss in detail who would benefit from incorporating Ai in schools and what age group it would be appropriate to start use at.
