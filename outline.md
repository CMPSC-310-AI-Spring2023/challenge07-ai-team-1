## Prompt

We are going to discuss how AI can make a positive impact in the classroom, and attempt to show educators how AI can be integrated into the classroom.

With that being said we first would want to discuss how AI in education can be a good thing for teachers. We also want to advocate for AI and how teachers would be able to curve out cheating and make AI a tool students would be able to learn from. We want to discuss in detail who would benefit from incorporating AI in schools and what age group it would be appropriate to start use at. We understand some of the concerns associated with AI in the classroom, especially from the educators perspective, so we will be addressing this issue.

Taking a deeper look into AI in education we can start listing the benefits and what specific age group it should implemented so it doesn't become a crutch. It also needs to be regulated too. We also want to start going into depth for each of these.

We also want to start figuring out how we could implement these changes into the school system. Some suggestions could be training for educators and making specific AI for educators to use in assisting the education curriculum. One of the benefits of AI is the personalization, which can be used to positively change students' experiences.
